            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas diuers Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes haue bin publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed heeretofore in way of anſwer to the Booke intituled <hi>The Hiſtory of Tithes;</hi> it may be, after this long ſilence, it will now ſeeme ſtrange, and be thought a worke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnſeaſonable and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, either to write or ſpeake any more of that ſubiect. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe the Hiſtorian himſelfe and many others, led rather with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, then judgement, doe ſtill much magnifie among the reſt, the
<pb facs="tcp:13484:5"/>
Iewiſh part of that Hiſtory, (as though ſome hidden matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance were involued therein) I hope it ſhall not be offenſiue to any, (ſith this paſſage as yet hath not bin ſcanned) if I as another witnes in the ſame cauſe, endeauour only to bring in ſome evidence not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that may helpe to vnfold &amp; cleare ſundrie doubts and queſtions in this kind. For albeit the Author of the Hiſtory in the Praeface there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, offring it to the triall of the moſt cenſorious examination, with a challenge againſt all opponents in his poëticall phraſe;
<q>Si falſa eſt, accingere contra, &amp;c.</q>
doth thereby inſinuate that he hath written nothing but infallible truth: And though alſo the authoritie of
<pb facs="tcp:13484:5"/>
the Iewiſh Writers againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of the Church in Tithes, be alleaged with much confidence and oſtentation, and receiued alſo with great applauſe, and more then ordinary approbation: yet let praeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and partiality with other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſpects be laid aſide, and I make no doubt but there will appeare as much defect and errour, euen in this part of the Hiſtory, as in any other whatſoeuer; and that the writings of the Iewes, though we depend not on them (becauſe in many things they are vaine and fabulous) yet take them as they are, being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, will afford more grounds of proofe for the diuine right of Tithes, then either hath as yet from them, or can bee ſhewed againſt it.
<pb facs="tcp:13484:6"/>
I did wiſh &amp; expect that a more able workeman would haue vndertaken this taske; and therefore theſe papers of mine, which long ſince haue bin viewed and cenſured, were neither at the firſt intended, nor after haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Preſſe. But ſeeing in all this time I heare of no other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this nature, either perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or promiſed, I haue at length yeelded to the deſire and perſwaſion of ſuch as might command me to publiſh this; the rather, becauſe not long after the firſt appearing of the Hiſtory, I did in a publike Sermon take exception againſt diuerſe parts thereof, which being diſtaſtefull to ſome hearers, I thought it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne me for better ſatiſfaction, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to the Eye as to the Eare, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie

with my pen, what I avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Pulpit; and the ſame, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other obſeruations, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to open view: the intendment whereof ayming at nothing elſe but manifeſtation and confirmation of truth, I am not carefull, neither doe I thinke it needfull, for this attempt to make any long apology.

               <p>This manner of expounding the Text, cannot ſtand; for beſides the vnſit connection, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of two ſeuerall texts, to make a new ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the intendment of the Apoſtle, and iudgment of all interpreters, his concluſion is not ſound: for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did not pay the tithe of all the ſpoiles; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his owne part of the ſpoyles: The young men had eaten part of them, before <hi>Abraham</hi> came to <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> as I lately mentioned. And if <hi>Abraham</hi> paide tithe of all the ſpoyles, then he payde of that which was not his own, which to doe were iniuſtice; for <hi>Aner, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> which were confederate with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.13. and went with him to warre, had alſo their ſhare and part in the ſpoyles. ver. 24.</p>

               <p>Some are ſo farre from thinking that <hi>Abraham</hi> payde tithe of all the ſpoyles, as that on the contrary they hold, that he payde no tithe of the ſpoyles at all, becauſe he ſaid to the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi> that <hi>he would not take ſo much as a threed or ſhoo-latchet of all that was his.</hi> But <hi>Ramban</hi> anſweres this, in the teſtimony before cited, where he ſaith,

i.

i. <hi>It may ſeeme at the firſt view, that</hi> Abraham's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and will was to take all the ſubſtance to himſelfe; and this is that which the Scripture teſtifieth, that he gaue the tithe, euen as a man giues the tithe of his goods. And ſo it is ſaid, the King of Sodome came forth to meet him, that is to ſay, in reſpect of his ſubſtance; &amp; when he ſaw that he did not giue it him, nor conſent thereto, he intreated him, ſaying, giue me the perſons.</hi> But our <hi>Rabbine</hi> is not cleare or reſolute in his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; for behold <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not take of all that is thine ſo much as a threed or ſhoo-latchet, &amp;c.</hi> for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13484:15"/>
ſo according to this expoſition he ſhould pay tithe of that which was not his owne; to this therfore our <hi>Rabbine</hi> ſaith, <hi>that certainly by right it was his, but by reaſon of his great kindneſſe and exceeding bounty, he would not take any thing, for</hi> Abraham <hi>truſted in his God, that he would giue him ſubſtance, and riches, and honor, and therefore would take nothing from him, leſt he ſhould ſay that he made</hi> Abraham <hi>rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The drift therefore of this anſwer is in effect to ſhew that <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue tithe of the ſpoyles, and yet of his own goods, for that the ſpoyles were his owne gotten in iuſt warre, and giuen without any wrong to the King of <hi>Sodome;</hi> and whereas <hi>Aner, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre</hi> retain'd to themſelues their part of the ſpoyles, it ſhewes that <hi>Abraham's</hi> giuing of his part, was of his owne voluntary curteſie, and not of any neceſſity. By this therefore that hath bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, it is euident, according to the opinion of the Iewes, that <hi>Abraham</hi> dayde tithe of the ſpoiles, yet they doe not teach, that he payde tithe only of the ſpoyles, but the contrary; for <hi>R.

His right therfore in tithing muſt no way be leſſe, but rather greater then <hi>Levi's</hi> was; which being proued only by the practiſe of <hi>Abraham's</hi> tithing; the Apoſtle doubtleſſe doth here intend, that ſuch Tithes at the leaſt as <hi>Levi</hi> receiued, ſuch alſo he payde in <hi>Abraham.</hi> But <hi>Levi</hi> did not receiue Tithes only of the ſpoiles; therefore he did not pay Tithes only of the ſpoiles. Nay I adde further, that <hi>Levi</hi> did not receiue any Tithe of the ſpoyles, or any part of the ſpoyles at all; for ſo the Iewes teach from theſe Texts of Scripture, Deut. 18.1. <hi>The Prieſts of the Levites, &amp; all the Tribe of Levi, ſhall haue no part nor inheritance with Iſrael;</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Iarchi,</hi>

               <p>Againe, when the Apoſtle ſaith, ver. 8. <hi>Here men that die receiue tithes, but here he receiueth them of whom it is witneſſed, that he liueth:</hi> he ſpeakes in the plurall number <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which being in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13484:18"/>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> bee proued greater then <hi>Levi's</hi> in regard of the right of tithing, if <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> receiue tithe but once, and of one perſon, and that only of ſpoyles, &amp; that alſo by curteſie, when as <hi>Levi</hi> receiued them often, and of many perſons, &amp; of all things preſcribed in the Law, &amp; that by diuine authority; for ver. 5. they had a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to take Tithes. Surely this wil not argue a ſuperiority, but rather an inferiority in <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek's</hi> Prieſthood in regard of tithing, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the drift of the Apoſtle. Therefore I rather thinke whereas it is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2. firſt that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham gaue tithe of all things, and after gaue alſo the tithe of the ſpoyles,</hi> ver. 4. That the Apoſtle here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds an other argument to proue the greatneſſe of <hi>Melchiſedek's</hi> Prieſthood aboue the Leviticall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> did not onely pay to <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> tithe of all things aſwell as they did in the Law to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> but alſo gaue the tithe of the ſpoyles, which the Iewes ſay was not giuen in the Law. And ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement for this may be gathered from the words of the Text it ſelfe; for in the firſt place it is ſaid in the Greek, ver. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

had bin more free, &amp; more then was in vſe in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall</hi> Law, for no doubt but the Apoſtle (brought vp at <hi>Gamaliel's</hi> feet) was well acquainted with the manner &amp; practiſe of the Iewes in the payment of their Tithes.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer they teach, that no Tithe or part of ſpoyles was giuen to <hi>Leui,</hi> yet <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. in the teſtimony before cited, doth plainely ſhew, that the Tithe of ſpoyles is to be giuen to him that is a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedek;</hi> for of him he ſaith, <hi>Iſrael ſhall fight, and thou ſhalt receiue the tithe as</hi> Melchiſedek <hi>did of</hi> Abraham. Now the Tithe taken after the fighting of a battell, what is it elſe but the Tithe of ſpoyles, except by a Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we vnderſtand by fighting; not only the action of ſouldiers in time of warre, but alſo the exerciſe of other Arts and vocations in time of peace. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, the Apoſtle proueth <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> to be greater then <hi>Leui</hi> from the right of tithing, not only in regard of the perſons that payde tithe vnto him, to wit, <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Levi,</hi> &amp; the continuance of the payment, he receiuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is witneſſed, <hi>that he liueth;</hi> but alſo in reſpect of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whereof tithes were pay'd, that is, of all things; yea euen of the ſpoyles, vnder which both perſonall and praediall Tithes may be comprehended,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Syriaque</hi> &amp; <hi>Arabique</hi> tranſlations of the New Teſtament agree with this. And the teſtimonies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for <hi>Abraham's</hi> tithing of ſpoyles, doe none of them ſhew that he payde tithe only of the ſpoiles, but that he did pay the tithe of ſpoiles, which we doe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13484:19"/>
not deny. And if the tithe of ſpoyles was God's part, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelues doe teach, in <hi>Abraham's</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; then much more the Tithe of other goods, which in many things are obtain'd, not by the labour &amp; induſtry of man, but only by the gracious proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; bleſſing of God.

And if <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were therefore both of them to be accounted Prieſts, becauſe both of them did offer ſacrifice, then was not the Prieſthood before <hi>Aaron,</hi> wholly annexed to the firſt-borne of families; for <hi>Abel</hi> was no firſt-borne, and yet the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Abel</hi> was accepted, and not the ſacrifice of <hi>Cain.</hi> But our author hath not yet done with this Treatiſe of the Prieſthood, he preſſeth it further, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Whence obſerue by the way, that both Abraham and Iacob, according to the right of that time, muſt be

                  <p>This text of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> quoted by <hi>Iarchi</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.4. and here alleadged by the Hiſtorian, is vnfitly applyed to proue the quantity of the Therumah ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolah, as <hi>Dauid Chimki</hi> here euidently declareth with very ſufficient reaſons, which are by him thus expreſſed:

                     <hi>I wonder at Iarchi his expoſition, for ſince that the Therumah by the Law hath no quantity, but one grain or corne of wheat, frees the whole heap, to what end ſhould</hi> Ezechiel <hi>come to teach the Therumah of an euill eye, or. niggards gift? he ſhould haue taught ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the indifferent Therumah, which is a fiftieth part: And againe, why doth he mention the wheat and barly aboue by themſelues, and the oyle aboue by it ſelfe for a tenth part, he ſhould haue ſaid, corne, wine, and oyle; as it is written in the Law,</hi> When as therefore the Ephah is the ſame meaſure with the Bath, and the ſixt part of an Ephah of an Omer of wheat and barly is offered, and not the ſixt, but a tenth part of a Bath of oyle, 'as it is ver. 14: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the Therumah of oyle was not ſo much as a ſixtieth part, but was only an hundreth part of an Omer or Cor, differing from the quantities of the Therumah before-mentioned.

for time to come, can not be a praecedent or warrant for the practiſe of times paſt; and therfore this Text makes nothing to the purpoſe for which it is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

                  <p>
                     <hi>For an Ephah being the ſame meaſure with a Bath, that is, neare our common Buſhell, was the tenth part of an Omer; therefore the ſixt part of an Ephah, the ſixtieth of an Omer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it muſt be remembred by the way, that there is ſome difference betwixt the Ephah and the Bath; for the Ephah is a meaſure only of things that are dry, as wheat, &amp; barly, &amp;c. and the Bath of things that are liquid and moiſt, as oyle, and the like; ſo <hi>Chimki</hi> ſheweth on <hi>Ezech.</hi> 45.11. and <hi>Iarchi,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierom</hi> on the ſame Text, where he alſo

                  <p>Now for theſe ſeuerall ſorts of Tithes before rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, as the Iewes confound the firſt and fourth, ſo other Writers in the reſt doe the like, ſome making the firſt and ſecond to be one and the ſame; ſome the firſt and the third, one.

belonged to the houſholder, the other to the poore. And though regularly they teach, that the poore mans tithe was payed only the third and ſixt yeares, yet in the place before-named, they deliuer it as a tradition of <hi>Moſes</hi> from <hi>Sinai,</hi> that <hi>Babel, Aegypt, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> payed the poore mans tithe in the ſeuenth yeare, and <hi>Ramban</hi> in his preface to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heraim,</hi> ſaith as much of the ſecond tithe, that the ſame was alſo payed in theſe places the ſeuenth yeare.</p>

I haue not done yet with the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13484:49"/>
teſtimonies of <hi>Iarchi;</hi> for if we marke them well, they will ſerue beſides the former ſlippes, to diſcouer the falſhood of three other concluſions deliuered in this Section, which as yet I haue not touched:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt is, <hi>that the Leuites at the Temple had an intereſt and ſhare in the ſecond Tithes for their feaſts and loue dayes.</hi> pag. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                     <hi>That the Leuites in the Country were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with this poore mans Tithe, or Tithe of the third yeare.</hi> ibid.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                     <hi>That the firſt Tithe was payed to the Leuites at Ieruſalem.</hi> pag. 13.</p>
                  <p>As the Hiſtorian doth ſhew neither Scripture, nor reaſon, nor <hi>Rabbines</hi> for the proofe of theſe aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo on the other ſide the only authority of <hi>Iarchi</hi> in the places before cited, is ſufficient to diſproue them all: For <hi>Iarchi</hi> ſeemes to be confident in this, that the Leuites ſtill held themſelues to the firſt tithe, and could not claime any thing due to them, either in the ſecond Tithe at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or in the poore mans Tithe in the Country. For although in the former Text, the Leuites, ſtranger, fatherleſſe, &amp; widow are ioyntly named together, yet he doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them in taking the tithes; and therefore he confines the Leuite to the firſt tithe, and the ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and widow, to the poore mans tithe. And this is likewiſe confirmed by other Iewes, writing on the ſame text, as <hi>R. Chaskuni</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28.

i. <hi>He ſheweth here that the firſt Tithe was for the Leuite, and the ſecond to be eaten by the houſholder at Ieruſalem: And in the</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>yeare the Leuite had the firſt tithe, and the ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and widow, the poore mans tithe. R. Bechai</hi> ſaith as much, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the firſt tithe was only aſſigned to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite, and not the ſecond a poore mans tithe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore the Hiſtorian ſaith, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euery third yeare the Leuites at the Temple miſt their ſecond tithe for their feaſts and loue dayes, the ſame being charitably and by diuine ordinance ſpent at home in the gates of the husbandman:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is nothing elſe but a fallacy, let him firſt proue, that the Leuites at the Temple had a right to the ſecond tithe for feaſts, and then ſhew how they loſt it, for otherwiſe how can they be ſaid to miſſe or looſe that which they neuer had. I deny not but the Leuites might be invited by the husbandman to the feaſts that were made of the ſecond tithe; and to that purpoſe alſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ierom</hi> ſpeakes on <hi>Ezech.</hi> 45. but this doth not argue, that therfore the Leuites had a right therein: neither was the ſame that is the ſecond tithe, charitably, and by diuine ordinance ſpent at home in the gates of the husbandman, as the Hiſtory here teacheth; That the tithe for the feaſts, which the Iewes call the ſecond Tithe, ſhould yearely be eaten at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> the Scripture ſheweth it to be inioined by diuine ordinance: But that this tithe ſhould ceaſe the third yeare, and the poore mans Tithe be payed inſteed of it, or the ſame be ſpent at home in the gates of the husbandman; it is a meere Iewiſh
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13484:50"/>
dreame, and no diuine ordinance, neither can it bee verified by any diuine euidence: Againe the words that he vſeth afterward to this purpoſe, are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity; for ſaith he,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As the Leuites miniſtring in their courſe at the Temple, were to haue part in the feaſts made of the ſecond, ſo were the Leuites, and the poore in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey entertained with this of the third yeare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the one is true, ſo I grant is the other: but as yet no proofe appeares either for the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the contrary. For <hi>Iarchi</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.29. &amp; alſo on other texts of Scripture before cited, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein with the reſt of the Iewes, teacheth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that in the third yeare the Leuite tooke the firſt tithe; and ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and widow, the poore mans tithe, excluding him from hauing any part with them in their tithe. Neither needed <hi>Levi</hi> to begge for a part among the poore, being alwayes ſufficiently furniſhed and maintained with his owne portion; for though the Iewes ſome of them hold, that in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yeares, there was a ceſſation of the ſecond tithe for feaſts, yet they all abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in the <hi>Talmud Roſh Haſhanah, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 12. <hi>that the firſt tithe, or Leuites tithe neuer ceaſed;</hi> both becauſe it is ſaid in <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.29. <hi>The Leuite ſhal come and take his tithe,</hi> as <hi>Iarchi</hi> explaines it, and alſo <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt tithe is their inheritance,</hi> Numb. 18.26 <hi>And therefore, ſay they, as an inheritance ceaſeth not, ſo alſo the firſt tithe ceaſeth not, or hath no end.</hi> And though regularly in the ſeuenth yeare there was no payment of tithes, becauſe no gathering in of fruits,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13484:51"/>
yet a compenſation and ſupply thereof was made in the ſixth yeare, by the bleſſing and large encreaſe of the ſruits for three yeares, and ſo by conſequent, the large encreaſe of the tithes, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Now for the third aſſertion, that the firſt tithe was payed to the Leuites of Ieruſalem, and ſo the firſt tithe of the third yeare:</hi>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for that other text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.12. It is euident that it ſpeakes of the tithe that was to be giuen to the Leuite, ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and widow that were within the gates in the Country, and here they were to eat it, as is manifeſt in the Text. Now <hi>Iarchi</hi> ſaith here, that the Leuite tooke the firſt Tithe, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, ſtranger, &amp;c. the poore mans Tithe.

i. <hi>The twenty foure gifts of the Prieſthood were giuen to the Prieſts, twelue in Ieruſalem, and twelue in the borders. The twelue that were giuen in Ieruſalem are theſe, the ſinne offering, the treſpaſſe offering, the peace offerings of the Congregation, the skinnes of the holy things, the ſhew bread, the two loaues, the Omer or ſheafe, the remainder of the meat offerings, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the log, or pint of oyle, for the leaper, the oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thankſgiuing, the oblation of the peace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the oblation of the Ramme of the Nazarite. And theſe following are the twelue that were giuen in the borders. The great heaue offering, the heaue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or oblation of the tithe, the cake, the firſt fruits, the firſt of the fleece, the ſhoulder, the two cheekes and the maw, the firſt borne of man, the firſt borne of the cleane beaſt, the firſtling of the aſſe, the dedications or vowes, the field of poſſeſsion, the robbery of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Leuit.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.7.8. <hi>Theſe are the foure and twenty gifts that belonged to the Prieſthood.</hi>

will eſteeme theſe to be but ſleight obiections, propounded onely by a polyanthean predicant a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt the learned and peremptory concluſions of a grand polymathiſt and predominant Philologer: And yet as ſleight as they are, they cut in pieces the one halfe of his Iewiſh Hiſtory. For his Dichotomy is, that the yearely increaſe is either fruits of the ground, or ca tell, hauing done with the fruits of the ground ſo far forth as <hi>Scaliger</hi> gaue him direction, he comes in the next place to tithe of cattell; &amp; here <hi>Scaliger</hi> leaues him; and therefore he writes at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on his owne head, contrary to the writings of all the Iewes; and for the vſuall manner of the tithing of their cattell he tells vs ſcarce a word of truth. And yet forſooth in his Preface pag. 6. he profeſſeth that <hi>to ſupply the want of a full and faithfull collection of the hiſtoricall part, was the end and purpoſe why this was compoſed, which might remaine as a furniſhed armory for ſuch as inquire about this Eccleſiaſticall revenue.</hi>

               <p>See now what a faithfull collection, and what a furniſht armory he hath here left vs. If any obiect, that this practiſe of the Iewes in tithing their cattell, may bee queſtioned as not agreeable to precept and rules of Scripture; for this I anſwer, that ſo the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of this Hiſtory may in that regard iuſtly be ſuſpected.

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if we leaue the Iewiſh Writers, and follow the rule of the holy Scriptures, I take it to be an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that the Tithe of cattell was to be payed to the Leuite, which though it be not plaine in that Text which is quoted, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 27.32. yet adde rhereunto <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.21. and then it is fully cleared, But conſider yet a little further what our Author hath deliuered in this 5 Section of his 2. Chap. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning cattell and the firſt-borne thereof, and the manner of tithing them, together with the rod to marke them, and then iudge if he hath not here brought his owne <hi>Rabbi Iarchi</hi> with a rod to ierke himſelfe; for here is a Tithe that <hi>Iarchi</hi> and the reſt of the Iewes doe ſhew the Hiſtorian hath fowly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and it is neither <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>firſt or ſecond Tithe.</hi> And therefore that diuiſion of his which he makes the ground of his diſcourſe, and labours ſo much to iuſtifie, though he accompt it to be the beſt, will in concluſion proue ſtarke naught; for this Tithe of cattell can not be reduced either to the firſt or ſecond Tithe: not the firſt, for that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Leuites, and was by the Iewes eſteemed

               <p>Againe, it is not the ſecond Tithe, for that was <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.23: the Tithe of corne, wine and oyle, and not the Tithe of beaſts, that alſo might be changed into money if the way were long, and the place of God's worſhip far off, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.24.25. But the Tithe of beaſts might not be changed, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 27.33. And if they bought cattell, oxe, or ſheep, with the money to be eaten at <hi>Ieruſalem, Deut.</hi> 14.26. yet that was not the tenth, nor to be accounted the Tithe of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, but ſtill the ſecond Tithe; and therefore the Iewes doe ordinarily diſtinguiſh them in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, calling the one <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Selden,</hi> are not rightly propounded for,</p>
                  <p>I. The queſtion is not whether the firſt-borne of other vncleane cattell as well as of aſſes, were not to be redeemed by paying a Lambe vnto the Prieſt; for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Selden</hi> in his Hiſtory makes no mention at all of the Aſſe; but the queſtion is, whether the firſt-borne of vncleane beaſtes were payde to the Prieſt in money, with a fift part added: for this affirmatiuely is M. <hi>Selden's</hi> poſition, ſet downe without any proofe, againſt which the Author thus reaſoneth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt-borne of the Aſſe, which was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſt, was not to be payd to the Prieſt in money, but was to be redeemed with a Lambe. <hi>Exod</hi> 15.13. &amp; 34.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Iewes teach, that no firſt-borne of any vncleane beaſt was payde at all, but only of the Aſſe, which is evidently prooved by their teſtimonies at large:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:13484:77"/>Whereas therefore the Moderator heere between M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Selden</hi> and the Author, holdeth, that vnder the name of the Aſſe are comprehended by a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche all other beaſts, vncleane for ſacrifice, giuing his reaſons to confirme it; admit without any further examination, that this were true, it nothing helps M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Selden,</hi> but more ſtrongly oppoſeth his aſſertion: for if not only the firſt-borne of the Aſſe was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with a Lambe, but alſo the firſt of all other vncleane beaſtes, then was not the firſt-borne of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſtes paide to the Prieſt in money with a fift part added.</p>
                  <p>II. The other queſtion likewiſe is not ſo, as it is here by the Moderator expreſſed. viz. whether tithe were to be paide to the Levite of the increaſe of Cattell, But whether it were paide vnto him in the Iewiſh manner of tithing, not what is required in regarde of precept, but what was performed in regard of practiſe: for this is that which the Hiſtorian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to teach by the very title of his booke; calling it, the Hiſtory of tithes, that is, the practiſe of payment of them. And ſo in this ſecond chap. his inſcription is in the beginning; <hi>How among the Iewes, tithes were paide, or thought due.</hi> Now it is evidently proued by ſuch writings of the Iewes (as he himſelfe ſaith) are teſtimonies beyond exception, for the practiſe or Hiſtoricall part, that their practiſe for the tithing of Cattell, is contrary to that which he hath deliuered.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that the expoſitions of the Iewes, and their practiſe here is not agreeable to Scripture, as the Moderator ſeemes to determine; To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13484:78"/>
that the ſame thing likewiſe may be ſaid of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other pointes taught in his Hiſtory, and vrged from the authority of the Iewes, concerning firſt fruits, Therumahs, and tithes, which cannot be iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Scripture, as I haue before declared.</p>
                  <p>If therefore now, leaving his former hold, he will diſclaime and forſake his <hi>Rabbines</hi> (for they here forſake him) and cleaue only to the Scripture for the right of tithing, omitting the Iewiſh practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then I make no doubt but we ſhall quickly ſhake hands: for though the tithe of Cattell was not paide to the Levite according to the practiſe of the Iewes, yet I hold with the Moderator that it ought to be paide vnto him, according to the precepts of the Scripture, and yet that text of Scripture, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27 32. which they alledge, doth not prooue it, neither is it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the 30 verſe, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Selden</hi> for an other purpoſe in his Hiſtory, pag. 13. following <hi>Scaliger</hi> and ſome of the Iewes, doth apply only to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tithe, contrary to the iudgment of this Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and contrary alſo to the true meaning of the Scripture, as hath been ſhewed already. True it is, that in that text of <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. there is expreſſed a declaration of God's right in tithes, and that the tithes are his reſerved portion; but the donation of them to the Levits, is elſe-where confirmed, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.21. <hi>For behold I haue giuen the Children of Levi all the tenth in Iſrael for an inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> from whence I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that if all the tenth were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Levi,</hi> then no doubt but the tenth of their Cattell, as well as any other: and whatſoeuer the Iewes write
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13484:78"/>
to the contrary, it is but frivolous; for albeit the tithe of Cattell (as they argue) be not expreſly named in the number of the 24 giftes belonging to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, (which alſo may be avouched of many other particulars) yet without any exception, it is plainly comprehended vnder the generall grant of the tithes to <hi>Levi,</hi> which to any reaſonable iudgment, is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Kings tithe, if it were ſo that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Selden</hi> did only write of tithes due to the Church; he might well enough be excuſed, for not ſpeaking of it; but the ſecond tithe, wherof he diſcourſeth at large, and likewiſe the poore mans tithe, are not properly ſuch tithes as are due to the Church, but rather to the Common-wealth, for they belonged to the houſeholder, and to the poore.</p>
                  <p>Againe, whereas in his Hiſtory pag. 13. <hi>He ſpeakes of tithes in this kingdome paide to the Crown;</hi> it had not been much out of his way to haue pointed at ſuch tithes as in the Kingdome of the Iewes were paide alſo to the Crowne.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, where he boaſteth in his Review, pag. 452. and ſaith, <hi>Hitherto could I neuer ſee any Chriſtian that hath fully taught what was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the generall payment of tithes among the Iewes &amp;c:</hi> ſince he would haue vs to expect more from him in this kinde then any other Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, we are not much to be blamed for putting him in mind of omitting the Kings tithe, for that is alſo comprehended vnder the generall payment of tithes among the Iewes.</p>

               <p>Albeit this Hiſtory makes a difference betwixt the Iewiſh Lawyers and the Phariſes, as if they were of two ſeverall ſides, for the matter and maner of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet no ſuch difference appears in the due ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them: for doth not the tithing of Hyſſop and ſweete Marierom before mentioned, and the like to theſe preſcribed in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> reach as far as the Phariſes practiſe in tithing of Mynt and Anniſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13484:83"/>
and other herbs; notwithſtanding let the Talmudiſts and Phariſes agree or diſagree as they will, the admonition of our Sauiour, though ſomwhat too ſleightly here alledged, doth fully decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: for he approuing and iuſtifyng the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes payment, doth herein teach vs how to iudge aright, without any further queſtion.</p>
               <p>And though this admonition was giuen while yet the Moſaicall Lawes were not all expired by the <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> yet after thoſe Lawes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired it is not to be ſuppoſed that then all tithes ceaſed, or were to be conſumed by the <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum eſt;</hi> for it is evident that the payment of tithes hath been duly obſerued in the Church of God both before and alſo after the Moſaicall Lawes.</p>

And yet notwithſtanding all this, they are conſtant in opinion that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall ſtill continue without any change thereof: and therefore though the practiſe for payment of firſt fruits, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumahs and tithes with them ceaſed, yet the law of theſe ceaſed not, but in their iudgment is ſtill of force, even as it was alſo before the payment of theſe was in vſe.

               <p>The Hiſtorian therefore (as it ſeemes) perceiuing this errour, in his <hi>Review</hi> pag. 455. goes about to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his bill, and to diſtinguiſh, and ſay; <hi>That of them that take the profits of land among the Samaritans, or in Aram, that is, Syria, muſt be vnderſtood of a Iew dwelling among them, and tilling the land there; for regularly if the fruits of lands in Syria were taken by a Iew, reſiding ſtill in his owne Countrey, he was to pay tithe of them.

               <p>But how doth he proue that this muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Iew dwelling among them, and tilling the land there? for no ſuch diſtinction, limitation, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception appeares in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or in the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries thereof.

But as for the Moſaicall Lawes and mandate of God concerning Levi, we make it not the ground of our title to tithes. <hi>And where he would haue vs examine which of the two kinds are due in the Evangelicall Prieſthood, why not the ſecond as well as the firſt;</hi> This hath beene fully anſwered by them that haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this argument, and haue made a more perfect diviſion of tithes, then this of firſt and ſecond: but becauſe (as it ſeemes) the Iewes are in more credit with him then others, he may for this point haue alſo ſatiſfaction from them: In the <hi>Talmud Roſh Haſhanah cap.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 12. on that text <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.26. <hi>which I haue giuen you
